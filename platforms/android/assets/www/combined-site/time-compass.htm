<h3>Determining Time using Sun and Compass</h3>
<p>If you have a Compass, you can use the Sun as a Clock.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply face your North, and then the angle of your shadow is the angle of the hour-hand on a Clock.</li>
</ul>
<small>see the Watch and Compass on your cell phone for precise angles</small><br/>
