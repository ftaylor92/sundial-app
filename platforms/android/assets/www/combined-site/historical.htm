<p>The Sun <u>always</u> Rises in the East and Sets in the West.</p>
<p>But the time and angle in the sky of the Sun changes through the seasons.</p>
<p>The Sun "gets stuck" at the same point on the horizon for a week at the Solstices.  This angle is what is tracked by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretelescopic_astronomy#Oldest_observatories">ancient observatories</a> like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goseck_circle">Goseck Circle</a> dating back to 4900 B.C.  This time when the Sun got "stuck" must have been alarming to pre-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus">Copernican</a> people.</p>
<p>According to <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Discovery-Middle-Earth-Mapping/dp/039308163X">The Discovery of Middle Earth</a></cite>, the Heraklean Way was mapped across Europe using the same Solstice angle of the Sun: <table><tr><td><img src="./img/heraklean.png" />.  </td><td stle="vertical-align:text-top;vertical-align:top;">The Heraklean Way goes through Andora, Coeals, Muntaner, Ordino, Marsailles, Matromona Pass (57.53&deg;), Norbonne (56.28&deg;), Nimes, Brian&ccedil;on, Deneuvre, Agatha, Sacred Promitory and Matrimona Pass.<br/>Many roads in Europe, UK and Ireland prefectly align with the angle of the Sun at the Solstices.  The Celts and Druids used Tan(11&div;7)=56.53&deg; as their Solstice angle.  England (and the world) currently use Tan(4&div;3)53.13&deg;.  The Pagans in Ireland used Tan(9&div;5)=57.96&deg; to 59.94&deg;.</td></tr></table></p>
<p>There as many types of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_sundials">historical sundials</a>, including the Dial of Ahaz which is described in The Bible, see Isaiah 18:8 and 2 Kings 20:11.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galations">Galations</a> of The Bible were named after Celts from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaul">Gaul</a> in North-West France, which used to be called "Celtica".</p>
<p>These people used Sundials: Anaximander of Miletus, Alexander the Great, Eucllid, Shakespeare mentions Sundials in <em>As You Like It</em>, Act 2, scene 3.</p>
