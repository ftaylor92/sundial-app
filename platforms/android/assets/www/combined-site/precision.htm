<h3>Sun Changes through the Seasons</h3>
<img height=217 width=267 src="./img/diurnal.jpg" />
<p>The Sun <u>always</u> Rises in the East and Sets in the West.</p>
<p>But the time and angle in the sky of the Sun changes through the seasons, so SunDial shadows will change slightly too.  Daylight Savings Time effects <a href="./img/templates.jpg">the measurements</a> as well.</p>

<p>As the Sun-light circles the Earth (actually the Earth rotates) every 24 hours past each Longitude, the timezone of each Longitude changes.  Every sphere, including Earth, is 360&deg;, so there are different timezones every "15 minutes" of Longitude: 24(hours) &div; 360&deg; = 15 minutes.  A timezone is just an offset from Greenwich, UK's UTC Time, so that Noon in Greenwich looks like Noon where you live +-timezone-offset.  You can describe a Longitude in Degrees and Minutes or as a decimal (ex. 42.5 Longitude = 42:30 Longitude.</p>
