<h3>Finding Compass Directions using Sun and Time</h3>
<p>If you know the time, you can use the Sun as a Compass.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply face your shadow, and then North will be the angle of your hour-hand on your watch.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox">Equinoxes</a> (Winter Equinox is March 20th, Summer Equinox is September 23rd), the sun rises exactly due East and sets exactly due West. </p>
<small>see the watch and compass on your cell phone for precise angles</small><br/>
